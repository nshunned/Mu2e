Muon to electron

2016_Feb:

The main goal of the analyses carried out in 2017 using data from the February 2016 experiment runs was to determine the behavior of the dicounter beams used in the Mu2e experiment with respect to the position of the experimental photoelectrons (which simulated muons), with an emphasis on the response efficiency towards the ends of the dicounters.

Each dicounter has two ends, with each end having four channels, two on the top counter and two on the bottom counter (hence di-counter). Single channel analyses were carried out initially, followed by two channel overlays (where one channel is selected from the top counter and one from the bottom counter). The lower regions of the end of the dicounters were further investigated for higher data resolution. It was determined that the x-position of the data needed to be manually adjusted to account the malalignment of the dicounters throughout the experiment. Responses were also normalized and ratios were taken for further analysis.

Additionally, data distribution and various position plots were generated to evaluate and illustrate the signal responses. A dip at x-position of 20mm was concluded to be a fault in the silicon photomultiplier sensor in one of the channels.

2016_June:

The data from the 2016 June experiments were analyzed in 2017 to generate the speed of light. The purpose was to illustrate and confirm that the photoelectrons used during the test experiments to simulate muons (which will be the target of the main experiment) indeed resemble muons in that they both travel at/near the speed of light through the dicounters.

2017_June:

The experimental data collected from the tests carried out in June 2017 were analyzed in 2018. The main goal of these analyses were to calculate the overall signal response efficiency (i.e. photoelectron distribution) for various configurations of the dicounters -- dicounters with silicone imbedded, dicounters with VM2000 reflectors situated at the ends, dicounters with optical grease applied at the ends, dicounters with different bias voltage applied to the silicon photomultiplier censors, as well as aged dicounters (using data collected from 2016 test runs).

2016_2017_End_Studies:

An additional "end" study (replicate of the ones initially done with February 2016 data) was generated with data from the June 2017 experiment. The two end studies were compared and contrasted.
